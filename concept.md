Travel Booker MVP Concept
Overview
The Travel Booker MVP is an autonomous tool designed to simplify booking flights with Finnair and hotels with Booking.com. It allows users to input their travel requirements in natural language, leverages generative AI to interpret these inputs, and automates the booking process on the specified websites—all without human intervention. Built with a Python backend, the tool integrates browser automation and AI capabilities, and is packaged for easy installation on the user’s computer with a single command. As a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), it prioritizes functionality over complexity, providing a foundation for future enhancements.
Key Components
Python Backend: Orchestrates the application logic, manages API interactions, and controls the automation workflow.

Browser Automation (browser-use Framework): Utilizes the browser-use framework from GitHub (https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) to automate interactions with Finnair and Booking.com websites.

Generative AI (OpenAI API): Processes user inputs to extract structured booking details, such as destinations, dates, and traveler counts, using the user’s OpenAI API access.

Command-Line Interface (CLI): Offers a straightforward way for users to input travel requests and view booking confirmations.

Workflow
User Input:
The user enters travel requirements via the CLI in natural language. Examples:
"Book a flight from Helsinki to New York on 2023-07-01 for 2 adults"

"Book a hotel in New York from 2023-07-01 to 2023-07-05 for 2 adults"

AI Parsing:
The OpenAI API interprets the input and extracts structured data, such as:
Flight: origin, destination, date, number of adults

Hotel: location, check-in date, check-out date, number of adults

Flight Booking on Finnair:  
The browser-use framework automates a browser instance to:
Navigate to Finnair’s website (https://www.finnair.com).

Enter search criteria (e.g., origin, destination, date, travelers).

Select the first available flight option (for MVP simplicity).

Proceed to the payment step (stops before payment in MVP or uses test credentials).

Hotel Booking on Booking.com:  
The browser-use framework automates a browser instance to:
Navigate to Booking.com.

Input hotel search details (e.g., location, dates, travelers).

Select the first available hotel option.

Complete the booking process (stops before payment in MVP or uses test credentials).

Confirmation:  
The tool logs and displays booking confirmation details (e.g., flight number, hotel reservation ID) to the user via the CLI.

Technical Implementation
Python Backend:  
Ties together the CLI, OpenAI API, and browser-use framework.

Uses Python to manage the flow and handle user inputs/outputs.

Browser Automation with browser-use:  
Since browser-use is a JavaScript-based framework, Python will interface with it by:
Running Node.js scripts via the subprocess module to execute browser-use automation tasks.

Passing booking details from Python to Node.js scripts (e.g., via command-line arguments or JSON files).

Automation scripts will:
Open Finnair and Booking.com in a browser.

Fill forms and click buttons using selectors (hardcoded for MVP).

Handle basic navigation (e.g., search submission, option selection).

OpenAI API Integration:  
A Python function sends user input to the OpenAI API with a prompt like:
"Extract origin, destination, date, and number of adults from: '{user_input}'"  

Returns structured JSON data for use in automation.

CLI:  
Built with Python’s input() function or a library like argparse for structured commands.

Prompts for travel details and credentials during execution.

Sensitive Information:  
For the MVP, users manually enter login credentials and payment details when prompted during the booking process. No storage is implemented to keep it simple.

Error Handling:  
Basic checks for common issues (e.g., no flights/hotels available), with a message to the user if the process fails.

Installation and Usage
Packaging:  
Structured as a Python package with a setup.py file for installation via pip.

Example setup.py:
python

from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="travel-booker",
    version="0.1",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        "openai",  # OpenAI API client
        # Other Python dependencies
    ],
    extras_require={
        "browser": ["nodejs"],  # Node.js for browser-use
    },
    entry_points={
        "console_scripts": [
            "travel-booker = travel_booker.main:main",
        ],
    },
)

Note: browser-use requires Node.js, which must be installed separately or bundled in documentation.

Installation:  
Users install with one command:
pip install git+https://github.com/your-repo/travel-booker.git (if hosted on GitHub)
or pip install travel-booker (if published to PyPI).

Post-installation, users may need to run npm install browser-use in the package directory or globally, depending on integration.

Usage:  
Run the tool with: travel-booker

Follow CLI prompts to input travel details and credentials.

Configuration:  
Users provide their OpenAI API key via an environment variable (OPENAI_API_KEY) or a prompt at runtime.

MVP Limitations
Browser-use Integration:  
Assumes browser-use can automate external websites (Finnair, Booking.com). If it’s more suited for enhancing browser apps, adjustments may be needed (e.g., switching to Selenium/Playwright).

Error Handling:  
Limited to basic scenarios; complex errors (e.g., website timeouts) may halt the process.

Website Dependency:  
Hardcoded selectors may break if Finnair or Booking.com updates their layouts.

Credentials:  
Manual entry required each time; no secure storage.

Scope:  
Assumes flight/hotel availability; stops before actual payment for simplicity.

Future Enhancements
Native Python Automation: Replace browser-use with a Python-native tool (e.g., Playwright) for smoother integration if needed.

Advanced AI: Add decision-making (e.g., cheapest flights, hotel ratings).

Credential Management: Implement secure, encrypted storage for user data.

GUI: Replace CLI with a graphical interface.

Robustness: Enhance error handling and adaptability to website changes.

This concept delivers a functional MVP that meets the client’s requirements: a Python-based, AI-driven tool using Finnair for flights, Booking.com for hotels, and the browser-use framework, installable with one command. It provides a solid starting point for an autonomous travel booking solution.
